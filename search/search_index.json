We develop IoT (Internet of Things) systems for everyday use that monitor vegetation and control the use of water. We design our systems to run on sustainable energy, be resilient and adapt to changing climatic conditions. Things We Make Our philosophy is to use inexpensive yet powerful IoT platforms to create easy to use, smart systems running on sustainable energy (solar energy among them) to monitor vegetation through visible/infrared-spectrum cameras and other sensors. Assisted by distributed computing and machine learning, these systems work with minimal human interaction to control water use for desired vegetation growth. Through data-sharing, we hope to integrate local/indigenous/community practices of working sustainably with the biosphere within the knowledgebase. Our Users Everyone -- easy to set up and use.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#folia-smart-science-of-vegetation","text":"","title":"Folia Smart: Science of Vegetation"},{"location":"#about-us","text":"We are a group of researchers committed to preserving plant diversity and reduce water consumption.

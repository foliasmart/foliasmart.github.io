We develop IoT (Internet of Things) systems that monitor vegetation, learn from the data and control the use of water for desired growth. We design our systems to run on sustainable energy, be resilient and adapt to changing climatic conditions. Things We Make Our philosophy is to use inexpensive yet powerful IoT platforms to create easy to use, smart systems running on sustainable energy (solar energy among them) to monitor vegetation through visible/infrared-spectrum cameras and other sensors. Assisted by distributed computing and machine learning, these systems work with minimal human interaction to optimize water use based on growth objectives. Through data-sharing, we hope to integrate local and community practices of working sustainably with the biosphere within the knowledgebase. Users Everyone -- easy to set up and use.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#folia-smart-science-of-vegetation","text":"","title":"Folia Smart: Science of Vegetation"},{"location":"#about-us","text":"We are a group of researchers committed to preserving plant diversity and reducing water consumption.

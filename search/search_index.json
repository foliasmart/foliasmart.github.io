Our aim is to have systems that respond to changing climatic conditions while helping preserve plant diversity. Things We Make We make use of inexpensive yet powerful IoT platforms to create solar-powered systems that monitor vegetation through visible-range/infrared cameras and other sensors. Assisted by distributed computing and machine learning, these systems would work with minimal human interaction to control water use for desired vegetation growth. Through data-sharing, we hope to integrate local/indigenous/community practices of working sustainably with the biosphere within the knowledgebase. Our Users Everyone -- easy to set up and use.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#folia-smart-science-of-vegetation","text":"","title":"Folia Smart: Science of Vegetation"},{"location":"#about-us","text":"We are a group of researchers committed to creating Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions for sustainable vegetation growth, and reduced water use.

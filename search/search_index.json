We design our systems to run on solar energy, be resilient and adapt to changing climatic conditions. Things We Make Our philosophy is to use inexpensive yet powerful IoT platforms to create easy to use, smart, solar-powered systems that monitor vegetation through visible-range/infrared cameras and other sensors. Assisted by distributed computing and machine learning, these systems would work with minimal human interaction to control water use for desired vegetation growth. Through data-sharing, we hope to integrate local/indigenous/community practices of working sustainably with the biosphere within the knowledgebase. Our Users Everyone -- easy to set up and use.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#folia-smart-science-of-vegetation","text":"","title":"Folia Smart: Science of Vegetation"},{"location":"#about-us","text":"We are a group of researchers committed to preserving plant diversity by creating IoT (Internet of Things) systems that monitor and control vegetation so it grows sustainably with reduced water use.
